# Albumentations: Fast and Flexible Image Augmentations

Albumentations is a powerful open-source image augmentation library created in June 2018 by a group of researchers and engineers, including Alexander Buslaev, Vladimir Iglovikov, and Alex Parinov. The library was designed to provide a flexible and efficient framework for data augmentation in computer vision tasks.

Data augmentation is a technique that involves artificially expanding the size of a dataset by creating new images through various transformations such as rotation, scaling, flipping, and color adjustments. This process helps improve the performance of machine learning models by providing a more diverse set of training examples.

Built on top of OpenCV, a widely-used computer vision library, Albumentations provides high-performance implementations of various image processing functions. It also offers a rich set of image transformation functions and a simple API for combining them, allowing users to create custom augmentation pipelines tailored to their specific needs.
